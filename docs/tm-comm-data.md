# Build topic models 

See the [example notebook](https://github.com/lingeringcode/nttc/tree/master/assets/examples) to see how to build topic models per community-detected submodules and save all variables to respective object properties.

Currently, to help name the community modules, you can use the machine-learning clustering method and/or the intertopic distance method to model each module's tweet data.
