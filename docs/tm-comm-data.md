# Build topic models 

See the [example notebooks](https://github.com/lingeringcode/nttc/tree/master/assets/examples) to see how to build topic models per community-detected submodules and save all variables to respective object properties.

Currently, to help name and qualitatively code the community module data, you can use the machine-learning clustering method and/or the intertopic distance method to model each module's tweet data.


## Kmeans clustering method visualization

By using this method, you will also create labeled clusters for each period's modules, which you can combine and output, as desired, for further qualitative coding.
